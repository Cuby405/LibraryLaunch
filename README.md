This is a launcher for apps you select. This open the CMD app. First check you can open it before download my app.

· To change the name and path of the app you want to open, type "C" and enter.

You needed to type first the name to see on the option number, and then you type the path of the app/folder/document you wanted to open.
· To quit, type "Q" and enter.

· To open one app, type the number and enter, you can't open more than one app at once.

Example:

---

LIBRARY LAUNCH

---

[1] - I want to open.

[2] - I don't want to open.

[C] - Change paths and labels.

[Q] - Quit.

---

Select an option: 1

IMPORTANT:

You could see more than one colour, that's because these app creates a new folder on HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Windows register. That's not a virus, it's because I wanted to change the color of some lines and other color in other lines.

If you type an non-existent command, the're would be a text saying: Invalid option, try again.

This app, for the moment ONLY can be used in WINDOWS, but I'm about to make it functional in LINUX.
That's all!
